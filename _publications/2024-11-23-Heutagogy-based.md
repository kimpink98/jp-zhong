excerpt: 'Recent research has begun to view AI as an independent collaborator and has explored the use of Human-AI Co-Creation (HACC) to foster creativity. However, it remains unclear how HACC practices can be designed to truly benefit undergraduate creativity. The solution to this issue lies in the creation of autonomous learners who can maintain agency in their interactions with AI, aligning with the core idea of Heutagogy. Therefore, this position paper proposes a conceptual framework of HACC for enhancing undergraduate creativity, and explores how the principles of heutagogy can be mapped onto the design of HACC practice.'
