excerpt: 'This study is about how to design human-AI co-creation practices that genuinely enhance undergraduate creativity. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into learning and work environments, students need to develop the ability to collaborate with AI while maintaining their creative agency. Drawing on heutagogy—a learner-centered approach that emphasizes autonomy and self-determined learning—this work proposes a conceptual framework for designing AI collaboration experiences that foster rather than diminish students' creative capabilities.'
