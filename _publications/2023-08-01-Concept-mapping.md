excerpt: “This study is about how elementary school children understand digital citizenship and whether game-based learning can deepen their understanding. Using a conceptual mapping approach, we explored children's perceptions of digital citizenship before and after playing MinecraftEDU. The findings reveal that children tend to view digital citizenship narrowly as personal responsibility while overlooking the importance of active online participation. The study examines how game design, emotions, and value commitments influence these conceptualizations, offering insights for improving digital citizenship education in Chinese K-12 settings.”
