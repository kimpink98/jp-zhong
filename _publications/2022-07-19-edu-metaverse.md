excerpt: "This study is about examining both the transformative potential and significant challenges of the edu-metaverse in education. The research explores how edu-metaverse technologies could empower future education through three key aspects, i.e., promoting deep learning via comprehensive perception, supporting smart education through dynamic intelligence, and transforming school education by integrating virtuality and reality. However, it critically questions whether the edu-metaverse represents a genuine opportunity or merely a technological bubble, analyzing three major challenges, including the gap between public hype and hidden risks, technical difficulties with high implementation barriers, and ethical safety concerns that emerge beneath the technology's promising vision."
