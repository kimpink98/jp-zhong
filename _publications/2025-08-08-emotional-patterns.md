excerpt: 'This study is about understanding how different emotions relate to various roles in cyberbullying on Chinese social media. By analyzing over 11,000 comments through human-AI collaborative coding, researchers identified how bullies, defenders, bystanders, and other participants express six different emotions in distinct patterns. Drawing on Intergroup Emotion Theory and Emotions as Social Information Theory, the findings reveal that beyond just anger, emotions like fear, happiness, and surprise can help distinguish between these roles, which could improve how we detect and address cyberbullying online.'
