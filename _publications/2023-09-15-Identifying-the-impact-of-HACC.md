excerpt: 'This paper aims to explore the possible impact of AI on creativity and how students co-create with it in a way that optimizes its benefits. Whereas AI may challenge the position of humans in certain creative tasks, we argue that it provides multiple supports to the creative process. Accordingly, we proposed a conceptual framework of the impact of human-AI co-creation on creativity based on creativity theories and the SAMR model. Then we concluded with four principles of student-AI co-creation.'
