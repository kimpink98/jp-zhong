excerpt: 'This study is about understanding the linguistic patterns of cyberbullying on Chinese social media. By analyzing five cyberbullying cases using lexical analysis, sentiment analysis, and semantic network analysis, researchers identified distinct language features that differentiate bullying from non-bullying comments, as well as explicit from implicit bullying behaviors. The findings reveal how word choice, bullying types, and sentiment polarity vary across different cyberbullying contexts, providing practical insights for developing automated detection tools and informing interventions to promote ethical digital citizenship in Chinese online spaces.'
